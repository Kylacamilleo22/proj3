## Summary of Project 1:

Reflection:
This project was really difficult to start and finish. I struggled a lot with starting, I couldn't visualize what I really needed to do. In task 3, it was a great help that we went over the first step in the lecture, so this one wasn't as bad. Task 4, took me a while but not as bad, I just copied the code provided and went from there. Task 5, This one took a while to figure out exactly how I should implement the getenv, but I was able to figure it out and was surprised how simple it was. Task 6 is probably what took me the longest to do, exit command was not as bad and was pretty straightforward. I didn't get to the changing directory part, I ran out of time. History command, was a little tricky, I wasn't able to get the history_lists() to work, I'm not sure if it was an OS problem, but I did asked for help on this one. I didn't get to task7-10 as I ran out of time. It's mostly me getting confused and lost on what to do that I end up not doing much, I do wish I started the project more earlier. Maybe reviewing the C language will be really useful as I don't remember much of the language itself, and it's probably why I ran into so many issues as well. Also, I would have liked to go in-depth on the project description.
